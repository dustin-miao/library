This library is a collection of data structures and algorithms for competitive programming. 

If there is a bug or error in the code/explaination, please let me know [here](https://github.com/dutinmeow/library/issues/new/choose).

All code is compiled using `GNU C++17`. Note that some libraries only work in environments where `avx2` instructions can be executed.
