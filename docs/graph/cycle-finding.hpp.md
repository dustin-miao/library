    \nDetects and finds a cycle in a given graph, which can be directed or undircted.\
    \ If such a cycle exists, then edges (pairs of nodes)\nare returned. If no cycles\
    \ exist, then an empty `std::vector` is returned\n\n### Parameters\n- `const G&\
    \ graph`: A `std::vector<T>` that describes the graph, where `T` is an iterable\
    \ data structure containing integers.\n- `bool directed`: Describes wether `graph`\
    \ is directed or undirected. \n\n"
